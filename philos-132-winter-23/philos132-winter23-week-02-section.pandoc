```

## Venn diagrams and visualizing relations between sets

There is a standard way to visualize certain relations between sets, assuming that they are all subsets of some large set $D$ (for 'domain') that one can already visualize, usually as as a subset of the Euclidean plane. These are called Venn diagrams, where shapes in the Euclidean plane are used to represet sets. The following table records the correspondence between the relation which can be seen in the diagram, the corresponding set-theoretic facts, and the corresponding Aristotelian proposition:

<table style="width:120%">
  <tr>
    <th>Diagrammatic relation</th>
    <th>Set-theoretic relation</th>
    <th>Aristotelian proposition</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F is entirely contained in G</td>
    <td>$F\subseteq G$</td>
    <td>All F are G</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F and G overlap</td>
    <td>$F\cap G\neq \emptyset$</td>
    <td>Some F are G</td>
  <tr>
    <td>F overlaps with some part outside of G</td>
    <td>$F\setminus G\neq \emptyset$</td>
    <td>Some F are not G</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>There is no overlap between F and G</td>
    <td>$F\cap G=\emptyset$</td>
    <td>No F are G</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F is contained in the part outside of G</td>
    <td>$F\subseteq G^c$ (equivalently, $F\subseteq D\setminus G$)</td>
    <td>All F are not G</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<br>

In the middle column we introduce some further common set-theoretic notation, for those sets that are all subsets of some larger set $D$ (for 'domain'):

<table style="width:120%">
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Symbol</th>
    <th>Definition</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Intersection of $X,Y$</td>
    <td>$X\cap Y$</td>
    <td>$X\cap Y= \{x\in D: x\in X \wedge x\in Y\}$</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Union of $X,Y$</td>
    <td>$X\cup Y$</td>
    <td>$X\cup Y= \{x\in D: x\in X \vee x\in Y\}$</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Difference of $X$ from $Y$</td>
    <td>$X\setminus Y$</td>
    <td>$X\setminus Y = \{x\in D: x\in X \wedge x\notin Y\}$</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Relative compelment</td>
    <td>$X^c$</td>
    <td>$X^c = \{x\in D: x\notin X\}$</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Some authors also write $\overline{X}$ for $X^c$.

<br>

To illustrate all this, consider the following Venn diagram:

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <img src="https://logic-teaching.github.io/philos-132-winter-23/texts/Large-Euler-Diagram.png" alt="Large Venn diagram 1" width="700"/>

One can check that the following relations between sets are all true on this diagram:

<table style="width:120%">
  <tr>
    <th>Diagrammatic relation</th>
    <th>Set-theoretic relation</th>
    <th>Corresponding Aristotelian proposition</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> $P_1$ and $P_2$ overlap </td>
    <td> $P_1\cap P_2\neq \emptyset$ </td>
    <td> Some $P_1$ are $P_2$ </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> $P_1$ is partially outside of $Q_3$ </td>
    <td> $P_1\setminus Q_3\neq \emptyset$ </td>
    <td> Some $P_1$ are not $Q_3$ </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> $Q_1$ is contained entirely inside $P_1$ </td>
    <td> $Q_1\subseteq P_1$ </td>
    <td> All $Q_1$ are $P_1$ </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> $Q_4$ is contained entirely outside $P_1$ </td>
    <td> $Q_1\subseteq P_1^c$ (equivalently, $Q_1\subseteq D\setminus P_1$) </td>
    <td> All $Q_4$ are not $P_1$ </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> $Q_4$ has no overlap with $P_1$ </td>
    <td> $Q_4\cap P_1=\emptyset$ </td>
    <td> No $Q_4$ are $P_1$ </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<br>

Consider the following diagram:

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <img src="https://logic-teaching.github.io/philos-132-winter-23/texts/venn3.png" alt="Large Venn diagram 2" width="700"/>

Consider the following table, which has some blanks in it:

<table style="width:120%">
  <tr>
    <th>Diagrammatic relation</th>
    <th>Set-theoretic relation</th>
    <th>Corresponding Aristotelian proposition</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> $C$ is contained in $F$ </td>
    <td> $C\subseteq F$ </td>
    <td> All $C$ are $F$ </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> $C$ is contained entirely outset $G$ </td>
    <td> $C\subseteq G^c$ (equivalently, $C\subseteq D\setminus G$) </td>
    <td> All $C$ are not $G$ </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> $B$ and $H$ overlap </td>
    <td> $B\cap H\neq \emptyset$ </td>
    <td> Some $B$ are $H$ </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> $F$ and $H$ do not overlap </td>
    <td> $F\cap H=\emptyset$ </td>
    <td> No $F$ are $H$ </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> $B$ is partially outside $H$ </td>
    <td> $B\setminus H\neq \emptyset$ </td>
    <td> Some $B$ are not $H$ </td>
  </tr>
</table>
